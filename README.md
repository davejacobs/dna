DNA library
-----------

This is a sampling from a library I developed to work with DNA and molecular cloning. It is currently not abstracted much from the way I used it every day, so it may or may not be useful to you. I hope to generalize its functionality, but keep in mind this started off as a simple script to automate a task at work.

I've refactored this code recently, especially to remove sensitive information. I have not had access yet to fully test the refactored code on real data, so I'm not guaranteeing that everything works at the moment.

If I have time some day to generalize this, I'll consider publishing it as a library.
